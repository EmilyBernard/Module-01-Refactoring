        https://1stwebdesigner.com/refactoring-html-and-css/
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/refactoring-introduction-and-its-techniques/
    Next looked over CSS file to re-organize   
    In CSS combined "side-margin" or "Benefits" from 57 lines of code to 26 lines
    Moved "side-margin" code down to just above Footer to reorganize the code 
    In HTML replaced many <div> to semantic lables i.e.  header, body, side-margin, footer
    Continued to condense code in both CSS & HTML
    Added comments in CSS
